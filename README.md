# PIMA-Indian-Diabetes-Analysis

# Using Python Libraries and Basic Statistics

Some years ago, a research was done on a tribe in America(PIMA Tribe/PIMA Indians). In this tribe, apparently the ladies are prone to diabetes very early on.
The whole survey was done to understand if a model can be build on it and using the values of various parameters we could predict whether a person has diabetes or not. If a person is having diabetes, then early prevention can be done.

# Following are the parameters(features) used to collect the data:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)2)

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
